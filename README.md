# IPv6
Code I used to look into IPv6 addresses
Goals: Find why IIDs repeat in IPv6 addresses and fix that

3/5:
I started this github repo
With the rib file I have the ASNs of the IPv6 addresses so I should find the repeated IIDs and match it to an ASN
Thoughts - Go through all the unique repeated IIDs and find their /48? With that /48 then find the ASN?
