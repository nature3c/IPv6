<h1>How to recreate my findings</h1>

<h3>Getting the data</h3>
<p>
  IPv6 address were from: https://ipv6observatory.org/ <br>
  The rib files from: https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/archive/
</p>

<h3>Initial data organization</h3>
<p>
  Use the go code (to be put in here) to go through data from the IPv6 Observatory and collect the repeated IPs with high entropy. <br>
  Also, collect the IIDs with high entropy using (to be put in)
