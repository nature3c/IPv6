<h1>Code I used to look into IPv6 addresses</h1>
<p>Goals: Find why IIDs repeat in IPv6 addresses and fix that<br></p>

<h3>3/5:</h3>
<p>I started this github repo <br>
With the rib file I have the ASNs of the IPv6 addresses so I should find the repeated IIDs and match it to an ASN<br>
Thoughts - Go through all the unique repeated IIDs and find their /48? With that /48 then find the ASN? </p>
